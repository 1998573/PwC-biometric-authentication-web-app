Overview
This document provides a concise guide to the PwC Biometric Authentication System, which utilizes face recognition technology for secure user authentication.

1. System Components：
Front-end Application
Captures video feed and processes face recognition data.
Handles user interactions and communicates with the back end via secure API calls.
Uses web sockets for real-time feedback on face recognition status.
2. Back-end Server：
Node.js server manages API requests, authentication, and message queue.
Ensures secure and efficient data handling with Express, body-parser, and dotenv.
Designed for high concurrency and performance under heavy loads.
Message Queue Service
Offloads resource-intensive tasks like facial recognition processing.
Ensures reliable task processing and scalability.
3. Logging and Monitoring Service
Provides logging for error handling and task processing.
Integrates with real-time monitoring services for proactive issue detection.
4. Biometric Model Integration
Deploys facial recognition models on Azure or integrates within the backend.
Options include Azure Cognitive Services or self-hosted TensorFlow models.
Cloud Architecture Design Principles
Scalability
Stateless and horizontally scalable backend architecture.
Auto-scaling in response to high traffic using Azure services.
5. Modular Architecture
Code organized into modules for reusability and maintainability.
Microservices or function-based architecture for independent scalability.
6. Event-driven and Asynchronous Processing
Message queues for handling asynchronous tasks.
Event-driven architecture for efficient user experience.
Real-time Monitoring and Alerting
Integration with Azure Monitor and Application Insights for performance tracking.
7. Data Encryption
Encrypts sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
Secure APIs and Endpoints
Communication over HTTPS.
8. API access limited based on IP whitelisting or authentication tokens.
Asynchronous Processing for High Concurrency
Message queue for handling high concurrency tasks.
9. Design Creativity：
Main page design inspired by PwC's corporate logo color scheme.
Interactive accounting-themed illustration and facial recognition icon.
Sophisticated facial recognition model for detailed analysis.
